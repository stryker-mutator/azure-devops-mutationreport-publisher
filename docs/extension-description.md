# Mutation Report Publisher

Have you been using [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io) or any other mutation testing framework? With this extionsion it is easier than ever to see the results directly in your build result tab.

## Configuration

To use this extension all you have to do is add the `Publish Mutation Report` task to your build pipeline and set the path where the html report was generated.

Note: Make sure you add the publish step after the mutation test step and that you configure the mutation testing tool to generate the html report.

### YAML pipelines

In YAML pipelines add the following after the test step:

```YAML
- task: PublishMutationReport@0
  displayName: 'Publish Mutation Test Report'
  inputs:
    reportPattern: '**/mutation-report.html'
    reportDisplayName: 'My_Report'
```

### Classic pipelines

In classic pipelines it could looks something like this:

## What does this get you

You now get a new tab on your build pipeline where you can click through the complete mutation testing report generated by your mutation test run. When using Stryker the [mutation testing report](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements) looks like:
