# Mutation Report Publisher

Have you been using [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io) or any other mutation testing framework? With this extension it is easier than ever to see the results directly in your build result tab.

## Configuration

To use this extension all you have to do is add the `Publish Mutation Report` task to your build pipeline and set the path where the html report was generated.

Note: Make sure you add the publish step after the mutation test step and that you configure the mutation testing tool to generate the html report.

### YAML pipelines

In YAML pipelines add the following after the test step:

```YAML
- task: PublishMutationReport@1
  displayName: 'Publish Mutation Test Report'
  inputs:
    reportPattern: '**/mutation-report.html'
    reportDisplayName: 'My_Report'
```

### Classic pipelines

In classic pipelines it could looks something like this:

## What does this get you

You now get a new tab on your build pipeline where you can click through the complete mutation testing report generated by your mutation test run. When using Stryker the [mutation testing report](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/mutation-testing-elements) looks like:

## Changelog

### v2.0

From version 2.0 the publish mutation report task runs on node 20 instead of node 10.

### v1.0

From version 1.0 the publish mutation report task runs on node 10 instead of node 6. This means a minimum version of node 10 needs to be available on the pipeline agent. For this purpose the minimum agent version has been set to 2.144.0.

### v0.3

Support setting a custom display name for the report. This is useful if you upload multiple reports in one pipeline so you can give a unique name to each uploaded report.
